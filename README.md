## Overview of Statistical Analysis of Weather in Oahu
For this project, I was asked to analyze the weather in Oahu, Hawaii to better determine whether opening a surf shop on the island is a good investment. To better sell the idea, my investor, W. Avy, requested various analyses to predict the weather in Oahu going forward based on past weather data. In the following analysis, W. Avy requested temperature data in the months of June and December from 2010-2017. 

## Results:
There is not a substantial shift in the weather in Oahu between June and December, but the following are 3 identified differences between the two months:
1. The average temperature in June is 75 degrees and in December the average temperature is 71 degrees. While slightly chillier in December, the overall shift in temperature is minimal.
2. While the average temperature shift is minimal, in December the temperatures can drop as low as 56 degrees. In contrast, the lowest recorded temperature in June from 2010-2017 is 64 degrees. The highest recorded temperature in each month is much closer, with June's being recorded as 85 and December as 83.
3. There are approximately 200 fewer temperature data points for December than June. Both months have over 1500 data points over a seven year period, so it likely would not impact the overall conclusions of this analysis.

## Summary
By and large, there isn't a significant temperature difference between the months of June and December. Based on temperature alone, Oahu is an ideal spot for a surf and ice cream shopt, but temperature is not the only factor in determining whether Oahu is a good location. Further analysis should look into precipitation levels of June and December over the last 7 years, and both temperature and preciptation to other islands. With a better understanding of the preciptation, W. Avy can determine whether the weather in June and December is cold and rainy, warm and rainy, cold and dry, or warm and dry. Preciptation over the last 7 years can also better determine if there are particular anomalies in particular months (e.g. hurricanes). Comparing Oahu to other islands will just give better perspective as to whether Oahu is really the best island to place the surf and ice cream shop.
